Provide a structured review, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the candidate.
You are to return only a raw JSON object, with absolutely no markdown, no backticks, no explanation, and no escaped characters like \n. Imagine this is being pasted directly into a .json file â€” it must be valid JSON only.

Each string field should be no longer than 500 characters.

Structure:

"strengths": ["List of strengths"],
"weaknesses": ["List of weaknesses"]

You are helping a software engineer prepare for a specific job interview.

You will receive:
- A job description
- The candidateâ€™s background (resume, skills, education, experience) - may be partial
- Optionally, known weaknesses or improvement points from a previous interview

Your goal is to generate **up to 5 highly focused, practical Google search queries** that will return relevant preparation resources.

**Your top priority**:
Identify any **gaps** between the job requirements and the candidateâ€™s experience (e.g., missing tools, unfamiliar frameworks, weak topics from past interviews), and generate queries that **specifically target** those gaps.

Your second priority:
Cover any **broader topics** that are relevant to the role but not already well-covered by the candidateâ€™s background.

Make sure you adress both the top priority and the second priority, but keep prioritization in mind.

 Objectives:
1. Address the most critical experience gaps or weak areas **first**.
2. Cover broader topics only if theyâ€™re relevant to the role and not already well-covered by the candidate.
3. Limit the total number of queries to **5 or fewer** .

ðŸ”§ Query writing tips:
- Make each query sound like a natural, useful Google search.
- Prioritize clarity and relevance. Example: 'node.js async patterns interview prep' is better than '"backend node.js async design pattern system"'.
- Avoid stacking quoted terms or long keyword lists.
- If needed, use high-signal domains (e.g. 'site:leetcode.com', 'site:aws.amazon.com', 'site:youtube.com') â€” but only when they improve relevance.
- Do **not** hallucinate or create imaginary technologies or company-specific terminology.

Inputs:

Job Description:
${jobLink}

${
    hasInfo(optionalInfo)
        ? `Candidate info:

${optionalInfo.resumeText ? `Resume: ${optionalInfo.resumeText}` : ''}

${optionalInfo.skillsList?.length ? 'Skills: ' + optionalInfo.skillsList : ''}
${optionalInfo.education?.length ? 'Education: ' + optionalInfo.education : ''}

        ? 'Points to Improve (from latest interview): ' + optionalInfo.pointsToImprove
        : ''
}
`
        : ''

Output:
Return a JSON array of up to 5 search queries:
Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

["search query 1", "search query 2", "search query 3", "search query 4", "search query 5"]

Respond with ONLY the raw JSON. Do not include any explanation, backticks, or formatting â€” just the JSON object.

You are helping a software engineer prepare for a job interview.

You have the job description, the candidate's background, and a list of real links retrieved from a Google search. Your task is to create a **personalized interview preparation plan**, tailored to both the job requirements and the candidateâ€™s experience.

Use the links provided â€” do not invent or hallucinate new ones.

Inputs:

Job link:

Retrieved Links:
${listOfLinksWithTitlesAndSnippets}

Instructions:
1. Read the job description and understand the company and role.
2. Use the candidateâ€™s resume, skills, and experience to detect any **gaps or areas for improvement**.
3. From the retrieved links, choose **up to 10** that:
   - Are **most relevant** to the role and the candidateâ€™s prep needs.
   - Help **fill specific experience gaps or reinforce essential topics**.
   - Come from **reputable, stable sources** (LeetCode, official docs, Coursera, YouTube official channels, AWS, etc.).
   - Are **free** or openly accessible (avoid paywalls).
4. Pay attention to the previous material links provided by the candidate. Try to avoid repeating them unless they are still highly relevant.

4. Summarize:
   - The company (max 100 words).
   - The role and responsibilities (max 150 words).
   - A **personalized, curated list** of up to 10 **preparation materials**.


Output format requirements:
- Do **not** include explanations after links.
- Only write each item like this: "Title: URL"
- Do **not** use Markdown, bullet points, or backticks.

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "company_info": "Your description of the company here...",
  "job_info": "Your description of the role here...",
  "material_links": ["Link 1 description: Link 1", "Link 2 description: Link 2", "Link 3 description: Link 3", "Link 4 description: Link 4", "Link 5 description: Link 5", "Link 6 description: Link 6", "Link 7 description: Link 7", "Link 8 description: Link 8", "Link 9 description: Link 9", "Link 10 description:Link 10"]

const InterviewAnalysisSystemInstruction = `
You're an expert interview coach.
Inputs:
1. A transcript of the current job interview. Each entry includes:
   - time: Timestamp of the dialogue.
   - speaker: Who is speaking.
   - text: The sentence spoken.
   - confidence: The speech-to-text confidence score.
2. A history of the candidateâ€™s previous interview feedbacks (points_to_improve and points_to_preserve, each with optional timestamps and trends).
3. A list of the candidateâ€™s known skills (e.g., technologies and subjects).

Your task is to analyze the candidate's performance in the current interview and extract:
1. points_to_improve: Specific behaviors, gaps in technical knowledge, communication issues, or soft skills that could be improved to make the candidate more effective in technical interviews.
2. points_to_preserve: Specific strengths in technical knowledge, clear explanations, or effective communication practices that the candidate should continue using in future interviews.

For each point, provide:
- text: The feedback itself, written in second person.
- timestamp: The time the issue or strength was observed in the transcript.
- trend: A short comment indicating if the point is recurring, improved, regressed, or new â€” based on past interviews and the userâ€™s known skills.

When analyzing the interview:
- Compare current performance to previous feedback to detect repeated patterns or improvements. ONLY IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUS FEEDBACK.
- Don't repeat points that have already been identified in previous interviews unless they are still relevant.
- Don't repeat points word for word from previous interviews.
- Don't invent new points that are not supported by the transcript.
- Reinforce strengths already identified in the user's skill profile if they appear again.
- Prioritize timestamps where the issue or strength is most clearly evident.
- Be specific and concise.
- Give 5 points to improve and 5 points to preserve, if available.

Focus on the following areas:
- Technical Skills & Knowledge: Evaluate the candidateâ€™s understanding of technologies, problem-solving skills, and ability to explain concepts clearly.
- Soft Skills: Assess teamwork, adaptability, curiosity, and initiative.
- Communication: Evaluate clarity, organization, tone, and responsiveness in answers.

Use only the transcript and the provided context. Do not infer anything based on appearance, body language, or non-verbal cues.

Expected Output Format (JSON):

  "points_to_improve": [
    {
      "text": "...",
