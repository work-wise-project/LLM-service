You are to return only a raw JSON object, with absolutely no markdown, no backticks, no explanation, and no escaped characters like \n. Imagine this is being pasted directly into a .json file â€” it must be valid JSON only.

Each string field should be no longer than 500 characters.

You are helping a software engineer prepare for a specific job interview.

You will receive:
- A job description
- The candidateâ€™s background (resume, skills, education, experience) - may be partial
- Optionally, known weaknesses or improvement points from a previous interview

Your goal is to generate **up to 5 highly focused, practical Google search queries** that will return relevant preparation resources.

**Your top priority**:
Identify any **gaps** between the job requirements and the candidateâ€™s experience (e.g., missing tools, unfamiliar frameworks, weak topics from past interviews), and generate queries that **specifically target** those gaps.

Your second priority:
Cover any **broader topics** that are relevant to the role but not already well-covered by the candidateâ€™s background.

Make sure you adress both the top priority and the second priority, but keep prioritization in mind.

 Objectives:
1. Address the most critical experience gaps or weak areas **first**.
2. Cover broader topics only if theyâ€™re relevant to the role and not already well-covered by the candidate.
3. Limit the total number of queries to **5 or fewer** .

ðŸ”§ Query writing tips:
- Make each query sound like a natural, useful Google search.
- Prioritize clarity and relevance. Example: 'node.js async patterns interview prep' is better than '"backend node.js async design pattern system"'.
- Avoid stacking quoted terms or long keyword lists.
- If needed, use high-signal domains (e.g. 'site:leetcode.com', 'site:aws.amazon.com', 'site:youtube.com') â€” but only when they improve relevance.
- Do **not** hallucinate or create imaginary technologies or company-specific terminology.

Inputs:

Job Description:
${jobLink}

${
    hasInfo(optionalInfo)
        ? `Candidate info:

${optionalInfo.resumeText ? `Resume: ${optionalInfo.resumeText}` : ''}

        ? 'Points to Improve (from latest interview): ' + optionalInfo.pointsToImprove
        : ''
}
`
        : ''
}

Output:
Return a JSON array of up to 5 search queries:
Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

["search query 1", "search query 2", "search query 3", "search query 4", "search query 5"]

Respond with ONLY the raw JSON. Do not include any explanation, backticks, or formatting â€” just the JSON object.

You are helping a software engineer prepare for a job interview.

You have the job description, the candidate's background, and a list of real links retrieved from a Google search. Your task is to create a **personalized interview preparation plan**, tailored to both the job requirements and the candidateâ€™s experience.

Use the links provided â€” do not invent or hallucinate new ones.

Inputs:

Job link:

Retrieved Links:
${listOfLinksWithTitlesAndSnippets}

Instructions:

IMPORTANT: For each preparation material, output the item starting exactly like this (without quotes):

"title - [Link title]. description - [Link description]. link - [URL]"

Use this exact prefix "title -", "description -", and "link -", with proper punctuation and spacing. Do not change, omit, or reorder these prefixes.

Each item must be a single string.

1. Read the job description and understand the company and role.
2. Use the candidateâ€™s resume, skills, and experience to detect any **gaps or areas for improvement**.
3. From the retrieved links, choose **up to 10** that:
   - Are **most relevant** to the role and the candidateâ€™s prep needs.
   - Help **fill specific experience gaps or reinforce essential topics**.
   - Come from **reputable, stable sources** (LeetCode, official docs, Coursera, YouTube official channels, AWS, etc.).
   - Are **free** or openly accessible (avoid paywalls).
4. Pay attention to the previous material links provided by the candidate. Try to avoid repeating them unless they are still highly relevant.

If there are no relevant preparation materials, return an empty array for the "material_links" field. Do not omit this field under any circumstances.

5. Summarize:
   - The company (max 100 words).
   - The role and responsibilities (max 150 words).
   - A **personalized, curated list** of up to 10 **preparation materials**.

Output format requirements:
- Do **not** include explanations after links.
- Each item in "material_links" must strictly begin with "title -", followed by "description -", and then "link -", exactly as shown above.
- Only write each item like this: "title - Link title. description - Link description. link - URL"
- Do **not** use Markdown, bullet points, or backticks.

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "company_info": "Your description of the company here...",
  "job_info": "Your description of the role here...",
  "material_links": [
    "title - Link 1 title. description - Link 1 description. link - Link 1",
    "title - Link 2 title. description - Link 2 description. link - Link 2",
    "title - Link 3 title. description - Link 3 description. link - Link 3",
    "title - Link 4 title. description - Link 4 description. link - Link 4",
    "title - Link 5 title. description - Link 5 description. link - Link 5",
    "title - Link 6 title. description - Link 6 description. link - Link 6",
    "title - Link 7 title. description - Link 7 description. link - Link 7",
    "title - Link 8 title. description - Link 8 description. link - Link 8",
    "title - Link 9 title. description - Link 9 description. link - Link 9",
    "title - Link 10 title. description - Link 10 description. link - Link 10"

You're an expert interview coach.

Input: A transcript of a job interview. Each entry includes:
- time: Timestamp of the dialogue.
- speaker: Who is speaking.
- text: The sentence spoken.
- confidence: The speech-to-text confidence score.

Your task is to analyze the candidate's performance and extract:
1. points_to_improve: Specific behaviors, gaps in technical knowledge, communication issues, or soft skills that could be improved to make the candidate more effective in technical interviews.
2. points_to_preserve: Specific strengths in technical knowledge, clear explanations, or effective communication practices that the candidate should continue using in future interviews.

Focus on the following areas:
- Technical Skills & Knowledge: Evaluate the candidateâ€™s understanding of technologies, problem-solving skills, and ability to explain concepts clearly.
- Soft Skills: Assess teamwork, adaptability, curiosity, and initiative.
- Communication: Evaluate clarity, organization, tone, and responsiveness in answers.

Requirements:
- Be specific and concise.
- Provide a maximum of 5 points per category.
- Use only the transcript content. Do not infer anything based on appearance, body language, or non-verbal cues.
- Write feedback in the second person, addressing the candidate directly (e.g., "You clearly explainedâ€¦" or "You could improve byâ€¦").

Expected Output Format (JSON):
